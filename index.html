          The narrative visualization utilizes interactive slideshow hybrid structure, which allows the users to follow an author directed path through a slideshow. Two scenes are included in this visualization, the user can change scene by simply clicking on the drop-down menu at the top right corner. The first scene includes two charts. The bar graph displays the marks of 50 students. The doughnut chart displays the number of students in each mark range. Colors varying in this graph from dark to light shades are correspondingly in the ranges "0-4", "5-8", "9-12", "13-16", "17-20" in a clockwise manner. When the user moves the mouse on a specific student (e.g. student 25) in bar graph or specific grade range in doughnut chart (e.g.: 17-20), that specific data item will be highlighted with annotations. It will be cleared as the mouse leaves. The parameters of bar graph are student (student 1-student 50) and their grades(0-20). The parameters of doughnut chart are grade range (0-4, 5-8, etc.) and number of students in that specific range. When the user moves the mouse around the grade range parameter (e.g. 17-20) in doughnut chart, the bar graph highlights the corresponding students in that range (trigger), and the color of those students become less saturate.
